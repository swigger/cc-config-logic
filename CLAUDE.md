# Claude Code Refactoring Documentation

## Project Overview
This document records the refactoring work performed on `prod_test.js`, an obfuscated JavaScript file that appears to be part of a Claude Code configuration and authentication system.

## Refactoring Summary

### Function Renaming
The following obfuscated function names were renamed to be more descriptive:

| Original | Renamed | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `WN2()` | `initializeConfigSystem()` | Initializes the configuration system |
| `Lk0()` | `getCurrentWorkingDirectory()` | Returns current working directory from i2.cwd |
| `Fd1()` | `getCurrentWorkingDirectoryWrapper()` | Wrapper for getCurrentWorkingDirectory |
| `t0()` | `getCurrentDirectoryWithFallback()` | Gets current directory with fallback to original cwd |
| `_9()` | `getOriginalCwd()` | Returns the original working directory |
| `CZ()` | `getOAuthCredentials()` | Retrieves OAuth credentials or environment token |
| `KB()` | `isOAuthRequired()` | Checks if OAuth authentication is required |
| `UQ()` | `getProjectConfig()` | Gets project-specific configuration |

### Variable Renaming
Key variables were also renamed for clarity:

| Original | Renamed | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `dG0` | `isConfigInitialized` | Boolean flag indicating if config system is initialized |
| `EA` | `memoize` | Alias for lodash.memoize function |
| `$21` | `cloneDeep` | Alias for lodash.cloneDeep function |
| `jq1` | `gitRepositoryRoot` | Memoized function to get git repository root |

## Key Functionality Discovered

### Authentication System
- The file handles Claude Code OAuth authentication
- Supports both environment token (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) and stored credentials
- Checks for user inference scopes and subscription types

### Configuration Management
- Manages configuration across multiple scopes (user, project, local, policy, flag settings)
- Handles MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations
- Supports various connection types: stdio, SSE, HTTP, WebSocket

### Directory Management
- Tracks original and current working directories
- Provides fallback mechanisms for directory resolution
- Integrates with git repository detection

## Testing
The refactored code was tested and confirmed to work correctly:
- All function calls were updated to use new names
- Script executes without errors
- Output remains consistent with original functionality

## File Structure
The main areas of the code include:
1. **Imports and aliases** - External dependencies and utility functions
2. **Configuration objects** - Default settings for projects and users
3. **Authentication functions** - OAuth and API key management
4. **File system utilities** - Directory and file operations
5. **Settings management** - Multi-scope configuration handling

## Notes
- The original file was heavily obfuscated, likely for code protection
- All functionality has been preserved while improving readability
- The script handles Claude Code's configuration, authentication, and MCP server management
- Warning about module type can be resolved by adding `"type": "module"` to package.json
